# Hysteresis in Neural Networks — Part 1

This repository contains the code used in the blog post:

> "Training Order Is Not Innocent"

## What this repo shows
- Same model
- Same data (MNIST)
- Same seed
- Different training order → different retained knowledge

## What it does NOT show (yet)
- Weight-space geometry
- Interpolation barriers
- Representation alignment

Those will be released in Part 2.
